        "content": "<p>Packing for a solo trip is kind of like prepping for a date with yourself. You want to be practical, but also a little romantic. You’re the planner, the navigator, the “do we have ibuprofen?” person, the security detail, and the vibe curator—all in one carry-on.</p><p>After over a decade of traveling solo through 65+ countries, I’ve learned that there are a few low-key essentials that don’t make it onto most packing lists—but absolutely should.</p><p>Take a photo of your passport, travel insurance, and any important visas and email it to yourself. I also keep them in Google Drive and print a hard copy just in case. If your bag or ID goes missing, this tiny step becomes a game-changer.</p>",

        "title": "Cultural Tips for Visiting Japan: What Every First-Time Traveler Should Know",
        "content": "<p>Japan isn’t just another country — it’s an entire system of customs, etiquette, and unspoken social contracts that seem to operate like clockwork. I’ve traveled to over 75 countries, but the first time I traveled to Japan, it baffled me. It’s the only highly developed country that I’ve been in where everything is so completely foreign to me. I’m used to that feeling when visiting more underdeveloped countries, but I wasn’t expecting the “Why do they do that” thought that ran through my head constantly in Japan.</p><p>If you’re wondering what to do (and not do) in Japan, this guide is your etiquette cheat sheet. These cultural tips for visiting Japan cover what you’ll encounter in both the bustling streets of Tokyo and the quiet alleys of smaller towns, where the vending machine might be the only thing awake past 9 p.m.</p><h3>Don’t Eat and Walk</h3><p>Japan has some of the best street food in the world… and yet, eating while walking is considered rude. One of the fastest ways to signal “I am not from here” in Japan is to stroll down the street chomping on a snack. Even though food is everywhere — from convenience stores to those amazing department store basements — eating is considered something you pause for.</p>",
