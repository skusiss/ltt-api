    "content": "<p>A hugely diverse country, Malaysia is a hidden gem in Southeast Asia that is rich with culture, wildlife, and activities. It's a country where you can experience the beauty of tropical islands, enjoy the glitz of big city lights, come eye to eye with endangered species, wake up to the sounds of the rainforest, and feel like a local being invited into homes with open arms. Malaysia is one place that probably isn't on your bucket list, but it should be.</p><p>My (Annie's) first encounter with Malaysia was when I visited my father's childhood home in a small town on the island of Borneo. This wondrous place had so many new sights, smells, and sounds. Throughout my journey, I developed lasting friendships with locals who were so proud to teach me about their homeland. And we're all still friends...so you can trust that you'll be in good hands when you visit!</p>"

We'll lead you to some undiscovered treasures and you'll feel like a local getting into making fresh pasta and visiting local farms.  We have two Italy trips!</p>"
